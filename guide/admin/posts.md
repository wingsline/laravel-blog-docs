* **Title** — Title of the post.
* **Text** — Content of the post. Uploading images are not available when **creating** a new post. After it was saved you can upload images by drag & drop or selecting the “Insert Image” from the editor toolbar.
* **Tags** — (optional) comma separated tags
* **External URL** — (optional) if an URL is provided, the blog post title will point to that url.
* **Publish Date** — when the blog post will be published. You can even set a past or future date. Setting this date in the future and marking the blog as published, allows you to write a blog post that will appear **only** after the published date.
* **Published** — when checked the blog post will be available on the site.
* **Original Content** — checking it will prefix the blog post title with a “★”.
