# Installation

By default the package doesn’t provide a theme for the blog. You can install an example theme into the `theme` folder in the base path of the application (not in the public folder):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wingsline/blog-theme.git theme
```

If you decide to use the Laravel default views folder, you can also do that. The only requirement is that you put the theme’s config file in the
`theme/config.php`.
